## DESCRIPTION
Paradisata has two recommendation models. The first model is a recommendation for a tour guide and the second model is a recommendation for a tourist destination.

## TOOLS
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Collab
- Visual Studio Code


## DATASETS
We have our own dataset:  
Dataset: [Paradisata Dataset](https://github.com/acoramadan/Paradisata/tree/CC/Database)  

## Model 1: Recommendation System for Tour Guides
This recommendation model leverages a Collaborative Filtering approach using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to provide up to 10 top tour guide recommendations based on user ratings. Recommendations can be generated by inputting a UserID to retrieve a list of relevant tour guides.

### Model Evaluation 
Model is evaluated by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and accuracy. Result of RMSE is 1.02 and accuracy is 89.58%.

## Model 2: Recommendation System for Tourist Destinations
This model uses an artificial neural network with a Fully Connected Neural Network architecture. The model input is tourist destination data, and the output is the probability score for each destination. The destination with the highest score will be recommended to users.
