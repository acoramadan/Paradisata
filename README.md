## DESCRIPTION
Paradisata has two recommendation models. The first model is a recommendation for a tour guide and the second model is a recommendation for a tourist destination.

## TOOLS
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Collab
- Visual Studio Code


## DATASETS
We have our own dataset:  
Dataset: [Paradisata Dataset](https://github.com/acoramadan/Paradisata/tree/CC/Database)  

## Model 1: Recommendation System for Tour Guides
## Model 2: Recommendation System for Tourist Destinations
This model uses an artificial neural network with a Fully Connected Neural Network architecture. The model input is tourist destination data, and the output is the probability score for each destination. The destination with the highest score will be recommended to users.
